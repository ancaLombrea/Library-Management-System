# Library-Management-System

Library Management System is an application that simulates the platform of a library. The librarian, after logging into the account, can add and delete books, edit book-related information, or view the list of books and clients in the database. The client has the option to create an account. He can view the list of books in the library's database, and after creating the account, he can borrow or return books.

For implementation, I created a Windows Forms Application (.NET Framework) using C# language, within which I added 5 classes required for creating objects (Book, Client, Librarian, Loan, and BookDetails), 5 form items (LibraryInterface, ClientInterface, LibrarianInterface, NewClient, EditBook), and created a database with 5 tables (Books, Clients, Librarians, Loans, and BookDetails).
